## 课程介绍
### VIDEO ACTIVITY DETECTION
An activity is defined to be “one or more people performing a specified movement or interacting with an object or group of objects”.

Video activity recognition aims at detecting and tracking objects involved in the activities. It has been the subject of important research efforts due to the importance
of its everyday applications. Surveillance by video cameras could benefit greatly by advances in this field. The task of tracking and understanding what is happening in a
video can be very challenging.

The project arises from the TRECVID-2021 open challenge: For the Activity Detection task, given a target activity, the system is required to automatically detects and
temporally localizes all instances of the activity from a set of videos. For a systemidentified activity instance to be evaluated as correct, the type of activity must be
correct and the temporal overlap must fall within a minimal requirement. 

Students are encouraging to submit their work to TRECVID-2021. The schedule of the task could be found in the link.
